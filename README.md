ABSTRACT
   In today's digital era, AI technology is not only a trend but also a driving force for groundbreaking innovations. As final-year students majoring in Technology and Innovation, our research focuses on developing a cost-effective eye-tracking communication system to support ALS patients. The project is inspired by the story of Stephen Hawking - who battled ALS for 55 years and became one of the greatest physicists of the 20th century.
   Now, as I study the subject of "AI Projects" in my final year of university, I realize this is the opportunity to turn dreams into realityâ€”to create a technological solution that can assist individuals like Stephen Hawking. He once said, "No matter who you are, no matter what circumstances you face, there is always something you can do. I try to focus on the things that disabilities allow me to do, rather than regret what I cannot do".
   "Like a star shrouded in darkness, ALS patients long to shine. How can we ignite the flame of hope for them?". We believe developing an affordable AI technology solution to help them communicate is absolutely essential.
   Our system applies computer vision and AI technology, using Python libraries such as OpenCV, Dlib, MediaPipe, and Numpy to detect and track eye movements. The user interface is developed with PyQt5, focusing on simplicity and accessibility. The system can recognize four main gaze directions and blinking states to control a virtual keyboard.
The main components of the system include:
	A high-precision motion and blinking detection system.
	An intuitive virtual keyboard interface.
	A character input mechanism controlled by eye movements.
	Real-time video processing via a standard webcam.
The key advantages of the solution are:
	Cost-effective compared to commercial solutions.
	Minimal hardware requirements.
	Simple, user-friendly interface.
	Real-time processing and response.
	Future scalability.
   Although there are some limitations regarding lighting conditions and camera quality, the project aims to create a basic communication support tool at an affordable cost for ALS patients in Vietnam. As Stephen Hawking once said, "No matter how difficult life may seem, you always can do something and succeed. I try to focus on the things that disabilities do not prevent me from doing instead of regretting what they stop me from doing".
   With the knowledge from university and the guidance of professors, we hope to contribute a small part to improving the quality of life for ALS patients. Though we are still students with limitations in experience and resources, we believe that with youthful enthusiasm and a spirit of innovation, this project will be a meaningful first step in developing technological solutions for the community in Vietnam.
   

 Why Choose the Topic?
   In the quiet room, only the sound of Stephen Hawking's steady breathing and deep eyes looking towards the starry sky remained. Even though he was imprisoned in an immobile body, he still explored the vast universe with his superior intelligence. That image is always engraved in my mind, evoking a desire to do something meaningful.
   The ability to communicate is the thread that connects us to the world. But for people with ALS, that thread seems to be severed, making them feel alone and lost. Seeing loved ones facing this cruel disease, unable to share their joys and sorrows, motivated me to search for a solution.
   I believe that, with the continuous development of AI technology, we can bring a brighter future to people with ALS. A future where they can freely communicate, participate in social activities, and live a fulfilling life.
This project is not only a technological solution but also a humanitarian journey, aiming to help the less fortunate and contribute to the development of society. I call for attention and support from the community to work together to carry out more of these projects, bringing hope to people with ALS and other rare diseases.
