   In the quiet room, only the sound of Stephen Hawking's steady breathing and deep eyes looking towards the starry sky remained. Even though he was imprisoned in an immobile body, he still explored the vast universe with his superior intelligence. That image is always engraved in my mind, evoking a desire to do something meaningful.
   The ability to communicate is the thread that connects us to the world. But for people with ALS, that thread seems to be severed, making them feel alone and lost. Seeing loved ones facing this cruel disease, unable to share their joys and sorrows, motivated me to search for a solution.
   I believe that, with the continuous development of AI technology, we can bring a brighter future to people with ALS. A future where they can freely communicate, participate in social activities, and live a fulfilling life.
This project is not only a technological solution but also a humanitarian journey, aiming to help the less fortunate and contribute to the development of society. I call for attention and support from the community to work together to carry out more of these projects, bringing hope to people with ALS and other rare diseases.
